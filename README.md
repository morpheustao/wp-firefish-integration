Short Project Description: Integrating Misskey/Firefish with WordPress
Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a WordPress plugin that seamlessly integrates Misskey and Firefish with WordPress. The plugin enables users to automatically publish articles from their WordPress website to their Misskey/Firefish instance. It also provides a means to monitor and manage comments on these articles using the Misskey/Firefish APIs. This integration enhances the user experience by bridging the gap between WordPress and Misskey/Firefish, streamlining content distribution and engagement tracking.
Project Objectives:
Plugin Development: Create a robust and user-friendly WordPress plugin, developed by Redhunt07 as part of the www.foxyhole.io project, that integrates with both Misskey and Firefish instances.
Automatic Article Publishing: Implement functionality that allows users to easily publish articles from their WordPress website to their Misskey/Firefish instance with a single click or scheduled publishing options.
Comment Tracking: Enable the plugin to retrieve and display comments made on articles published on Misskey/Firefish within the WordPress dashboard.
User Configuration: Provide users with configuration options to connect their WordPress site with their Misskey/Firefish instance, including API key management and instance settings.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to ensure the plugin gracefully handles any connectivity issues or errors that may arise during the integration process.
User Documentation: Create comprehensive user documentation, including installation guides and usage instructions, to ensure users can effectively utilize the plugin.
Project Deliverables:
A fully functional WordPress plugin.
Comprehensive user documentation.
A codebase licensed under the GPL license.
This project, developed by Redhunt07 as part of the www.foxyhole.io project, empowers WordPress users to seamlessly connect with Misskey and Firefish, streamlining content sharing and engagement tracking while adhering to the GPL licensing terms.
